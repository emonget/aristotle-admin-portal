## Purpose

Aim is to build frontend tool (React + TS + TW + VITE) acting as database admin portal.

Tool will be built for very specific functional side and connect to specific database 
Data model stored in database is defined in separate repository and SQL schema can be provided to help with admin portal development.


## Features
- select specific movie from movies DB table and view all reviews linked to that movie
- stats: extract all reviews unique sources (based on review url domain) and associated reviews count. This will help seeing which sources have highest count of published reviews
- filter top critics reviews

- See all movie retrieval workflows, and associated movies 
- See all reviews retrieval workflows and associated reviews

- review content preview: this will have to fetch review from external url and process it to extract review content
- AI agent will review fetched content and report any broken links or invalid content.
